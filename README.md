# Frontend task - Movie API

**Level: Intermediate**

Hi there! We have a task for you if you want to join our web team @[COBE](https://cobe.tech/)!

Have you ever been in a situation when you didn't know which movie to watch? Your task is to build a web application for browsing movies. With _Movie Roulette_ feature users can easily get recommended movies by genre they prefer!

## Concept
We will provide you with a rough concept and an idea. Be creative, you can freestyle it however you like.

### Main screen
This is the main screen of the app. 

![Preview](https://github.com/cobeisfresh/frontend-tasks/blob/movie-api/images/main-screen.png)

* As a user I want to be able to scroll through the list of movies. This list should give me a short info about each movie including movie title, cover image, year, rating and language
* As a user I want to be able to click on the specific movie and get to the page with all details about the chosen movie
* As a user I want to click on the `LOAD` button at the end of the list to load more movies
* As a user I want to be able to open `Movie Roulette` modal by clicking on the floating button in the bottom right corner

### Movie Details

* As a user I want to get some details about specific movie including movie title, cover image, year, description, rating popularity, language and production companies
* As a user I want to rate a movie by clicking on the star icon (0-10)
* As a user I want to see my rating if I've already rated a specific movie

### Movie Roulette modal

* As a user I want to get a random movie by genre and see its details because I'm not sure what to watch

### Deliverables
+ You should provide us with a link to your repository
+ Please include a project setup steps into README.md so that we can run your project

### Rules & hints
* Use [Movie API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction)
* You can write your app in pure JS or use library of your choice - React (preferred) or Vue
* Styles should be written in Sass (SCSS) or [CSS in JS](https://medium.com/dailyjs/what-is-actually-css-in-js-f2f529a2757)
* Use a repository from the beginning, don't push everything in just one commit
* Pay extra attention to the code quality, formatting and best practices

### Bonus points
* Not using _starter-kit_ like [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
* Using type checker ([Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) or [Flow](https://flow.org/))
* Using linter
* App is deployed and live

### Extra mile
* [Snapshot testing](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/snapshot-testing)
* [Storybook UI documentation](https://storybook.js.org)
* Performance optimizations
* Suprise features that we don't expect to get
